# Installation and usage

1. Download the latest release here
2. Install it.
3. Run the program with Administrator permissions (asked by default - needed for making changes to the `C:\Program Files\Riot Vanguard` folder
4. Click on the Start/Stop button to start and stop the Vanguard kernel - you will be prompt to restart the computer, which is needed to apply changes to the kernel itself.
5. Reboot!
6. Check that Vanguard tray app isn't active (if clicked to stop in step 4).

**Note: Make sure to not change the startup behaviour for Vanguard Tray app (vgtray.exe) - it should be enable to launch as the computer startups, which is the default behaviour. This way Vanguard Toggler will toggle Vanguard on/off on each reboot automatically.**
